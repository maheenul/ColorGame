# Color Game Project #
*Completed as a part of the online course The Web Developer Bootcamp in Udemy*

***
This is one of the project completed during the front end web development section of the course ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

This is a very simple color guessing game created using HTML, CSS and JS. A RGB value is displayed at the top and the player has to guess the correct color by clicking on the square boxes displayed below. The game has three difficulty levels with the number of squares increasing as the difficulty goes up. 

Running the ColorGame.html will execute the game. Make sure the dependencies (JS and CSS files) are also in the same directory.
